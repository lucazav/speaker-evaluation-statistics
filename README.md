# Speaker Evaluation Statistics Report
When organizing events in which sessions are planned, it is important to gather feedback from participants in order to understand whether the interest and expectations of attendees have been met. Feedbacks are also useful to speakers, who can understand if the material prepared and the speech waere appreciated by attendees.

In order to collect all the feedbacks for each session, evaluation forms are often provided to attendees. An example of evaluation form to be compiled is this one:
